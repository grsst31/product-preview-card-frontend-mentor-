## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

-In screenshots folder, mobile and desktop views, including avtive state, minus cursor, because I couldn't take the pic without it

## My process

No real process, currently taking a course and trying to do small challenges as I go along.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

-Having a hard time trying to get the picture to switch from the mobile to the desktop, even though i used the <picture> tag, would appreciate some feedback. In the early days of learning, so looking for any help, thanks!
